    <p>In <em>continuous</em> simulations, the states of objects change continuously, as modeled by differential equations,
     using <em>fixed-increment</em> time progression. Continuous dynamic systems (like physical systems with material objects
     moving in space) can only be captured by a continuous simulation model, while discrete dynamic systems (like a predator-prey
     ecosystem) can be captured either in a more abstract manner by a continuous simulation model (like the
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations">Lotka-Volterra equations</a>)
     or in a more realistic manner by a discrete event simulation model (since birth, death and predator-prey encounters are
     discrete events).</p>
   <p>Notice that the concept of continuous simulation does not require using a continuous time model and a continuous space model,
    nor does it require using continuous state variables (attributes with a floating-point number range), though when describing
    a continuous dynamic system with a continuous simulation model it is natural to use a continuous time and space model and
    attributes with a floating-point number range for representing continuous state variables.</p>
   <p>Summary: The term "continuous" in <em>continuous simulation</em> does not refer to the underlying time and space models,
    nor does it refer to the range of state variables. Rather it refers exclusively to the nature of state changes, and we could therefore
    also speak of <em>continuous state change simulation</em>.</p>
   <p>The approach of modeling a <em>discrete</em> dynamic system with the help of differential equations has been called <em>System Dynamics</em>.
    A web-based simulation platform supporting System Dynamics is <a href="https://insightmaker.com/">Insight Maker</a>. Any System Dynamics modeling
   framework could also be used for modeling continuous dynamic systems such as physical systems. However, typical application domains of
    System Dynamics are biology and social sciences, where systems are essentially discrete.</p>
   <h2>Examples of System Dynamics Models</h2>
   <p>Notice that for all typical System Dynamics examples we could also have a Discrete Event Simulation model (often called "agent-based" or
    "individual-based" model since not based on modeling aggregates, but rather on modeling individuals).</p>
