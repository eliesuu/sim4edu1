 <section><h1>Model</h1>
   <p>The <em>Gossip Model</em> is a Cellular Automata model, using the concept of N/E/S/W-neighbourhood 
    (also called <i>von Neumann neighbourhood</i>) where a grid cell has 4 neighbours.</p>
   <section><h1>Information Model</h1>
     <p>An integer grid has been chosen as the space model. Grid cells have either the value 0, representing a 
	  cell that has not yet received the gossip, or the value 1, representing a cell that has received the gossip.</p>
   </section>
   <section><h1>Process Model</h1>
     <p>The model is based on two rules:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>If the cell is in state 0, and it has one or more neighbours in state 1, then for each of them, 
	    change the cell's state to 1 with some probability, otherwise leave it at 0. </li>
       <li>If the cell is in state 1, it remains in that state.</li>
     </ol>
