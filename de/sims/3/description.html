 <section class="mbd collapsed"><h1><span>►</span>Simulation Design Model <sup class="expl-req">?</sup></h1>
   <div id="expl-DM" class="expl"></div>

   <p>In this 3rd variant of our Service Desk queuing model, we model a service performed
     by the service desk as an <b><i>activity</i></b> in the sense of a business process activity.
     Activities are special types of events having some duration and using resources. Their duration may
     be either preset to a fixed value or to a random value (in which case they have a scheduled end),
     or it may be determined by the occurrence of an activity end event that is caused by another
     simulation event (in which case they have an open end).</p>

   <section><h1>Information Design Model <sup class="expl-req">?</sup></h1>
     <div id="expl-IDM" class="expl"></div>
     <p>A computational design for the purpose of computing the two statistics <i>maximum queue length</i>
       and <i>service utilization</i> is obtained by modeling the following types of objects, events and activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One object type: <b><code>ServiceDesk</code></b> with one (integer-valued) attribute
      <code>queueLength</code>.</li>
    <li>One event type: <b><code>CustomerArrival</code></b> with a reference property <code>serviceDesk</code>
      having the class <code>ServiceDesk</code> as range. As an exogenous event type, <code>CustomerArrival</code>
      has a <code>recurrence</code> function representing a random variable for computing the time in-between
      two subsequent event occurrences.</li>
    <li>One activity type: <b><code>PerformService</code></b> having a resource association with the object type
      <code>ServiceDesk</code> and a function <code>randomDuration</code> representing a random variable
      for computing the duration of a service (as a <code>PerformService</code> activity).</li>
  </ul>
     <p>By modeling the service as a <code>PerformService</code> activity, we get the service desk utilization
       statistics for free, since utilization statistics are computed automatically by a simulator supporting
       activity modeling due to its implementation of the general semantics of activities.</p>
     <p>The object types, event types and activity types described above, together with their participation
       associations, are visually described in the following UML class diagram:</p>
