/></figure><p>Let's look at an example. We model a system of one or more service desks, each of them having its own queue, as a discrete event system:</p><ul><li>Customers arrive at a service desk at random times.</li><li>If there is no other customer in front of them, and the service desk is available, they are served immediately, otherwise they have to queue up in a waiting line.</li><li>The duration of services varies, depending on the individual case.</li><li>When a service is completed, the customer departs and the next customer is served, if there is still any customer in the queue.</li></ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>object types</b> of the problem domain are:</p><ul><li>customers,</li><li>service desks,</li><li>waiting lines,</li><li>service clerks, if the service is performed by (one or more) clerks.</li></ul><p>The potentially relevant <b>event types</b> are:</p><ul><li>customer arrivals,</li><li>service starts,</li><li>service terminations,</li><li>customer departures.</li></ul></section><section class="role-section1" id="DesM"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">1.2</span>. </span>Making a Simulation Design Model</h2><p>When making a simulation model, the right degree of abstraction depends on the purpose of the model. But abstracting away from too many things may make a model too unnatural and not sufficiently generic, implying that it cannot be easily extended to model additional features (such as more than one service desk).</p><p>In our example, the purpose of the simulation model is to compute the <em>maximum queue length</em> and possibly also the <em>service utilization</em>. So, we may abstract away from the following object types:</p><ul><li><em>customers</em>: we don't need any information about individual customers.</li><li><em>waiting lines</em>: we don't need to know who is next, it's sufficient to know the length of the queue.</li><li><em>service clerks</em>: we don't need any information about the service clerk(s).</li></ul><p>Notice that, for simplicity, we consider the customer that is currently being served to be part of the queue. In this way, in the simulation program, we can check if the service desk is busy by testing if the length of the queue is greater than 0. In fact, for being able to compute the service utilization and the maximum queue length, the queue length is the only relevant state variable.</p><p>State variables can be modeled in the simple form of <em>global variables</em> or in the form of <em>attributes</em> of suitable object types. Consequently, the simplest model we can make for the given problem, called <em>ServiceDesk-0</em>, has only one global variable: <i>queueLength</i>. But, as an alternative, more explicit, model, called <em>ServiceDesk-1</em>, we will also model the system state in terms of (one or more) <i>ServiceDesk</i> objects having only one property: <i>queueLength</i>. As opposed to the simpler model defining <i>queueLength</i> as a global variable, this model allows defining simulation scenarios with two or more service desks operating simultaneously.</p><p>We also look for opportunities to simplify our event model by dropping event types that are not needed, e.g., because their events temporally coincide with events of another type. This is the case with <em>service terminations</em> and <i>customer departure</i> events. Consequently, we can drop the event type <em>service terminations</em>.</p><p>There are two situations when a new service can be started: either when the waiting line is empty and a new customer arrives, or when the waiting line is not empty and a service terminates. Therefore, any <em>service start</em> event immediately follows either a <i>customer arrival</i> or a <i>customer departure</i> event, and we may abstract away from <em>service start</em> events and drop the corresponding event type from the design model.</p><p>So we only need to consider <i>customer arrival</i> and <i>customer departure</i> events, modeled with the two event types <i>CustomerArrival</i> and <i>CustomerDeparture</i>.</p><p>The event type <i>CustomerArrival</i> is an example of a type of <b>exogenous</b> events,<a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__3"></a> which are not caused by any causal regularity of the system under investigation and, therefore, have to be modeled with a <b>recurrence</b><a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__4"></a> function that allows to compute the time of the next occurrence of an event of that type. In OES, exogenous event types are a built-in concept such that an OES simulator takes care of creating the next exogenous event whenever an event of that type is processed. This mechanism makes sure that there is a continuous stream of exogenous events throughout a simulation run.</p><p>We also have to model the random variations of two variables: (1) the recurrence of (that is, the time in-between two) customer arrival events and (2) the service duration. In a class model, such random variables<a class="role-index-anchor" id="DesM__I__5"></a> can be defined as special class-level (&quot;static&quot;) operations, with a stereotype «rv», in the class to which they belong, as shown in the diagrams below.</p><p>We model the recurrence of customer arrival events as a discrete random variable with a uniform distribution between 1 and 6 minutes, which we express in the class diagram of the information design model by appending the symbolic expression <i>U{1-6}</i> within curly braces to the operation declaration, following the UML syntax for property/method modifiers.</p><p>We model the service duration random variable with an empirical distribution of 2 minutes with probability 0.3, 3 minutes with probability 0.5 and 4 minutes with probability 0.2, using the symbolic expression <i>Emp{2:0.3, 3:0.5, 4:0.2}</i>.</p><p>Computationally, object types and event types correspond to classes, either of an object-oriented information model, such as a UML class diagram, or of a computer program written in an object-oriented programming language, such as Java or JavaScript.</p><section><h4>1.2.1. ServiceDesk-0: Modeling <i>queueLength</i> as a global variable</h4><p>As discussed above, the simplest model for the service desk problem with maximum queue length statistics (available in the Sim4edu library as <a href="https://sim4edu.com/sims/14" target="_top">ServiceDesk-0</a>) has only one global variable: <i>queueLength</i>, a non-negative integer, and a global function for computing the random service duration, but no object type.</p><p>An information model for ServiceDesk-0 consists of a special class for defining model variables and functions, and two classes for defining the event types <i>CustomerArrival</i> and <i>CustomerDeparture</i>, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#DesM__figServiceDesk0"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span>. </span>An information design model for ServiceDesk-0</a>.</p><figure id="DesM__figServiceDesk0"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-1</span>. </span>An information design model for ServiceDesk-0</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="IntroTutorial_files/IDM0.svg" width="360" /></div></figure><p>In addition to an information model, which captures the system's state structure, we also need to make a process model that captures the dynamics of the service desk system. The dynamics of a system consists of events triggering state changes and follow-up events. A process model can be expressed with the help of event rules, which define what happens when an event (of a certain type) occurs, or, more specifically, which state changes and which follow-up events are caused by an event of that type.</p><p>Event rules can be expressed with the help of pseudo-code or in process diagrams, or in a simulation or programming language. The following table shows the two event rules defining the transition logic of a service desk system, expressed in pseudo-code.</p><table border="1" style="border-spacing:3px;width:100%;"><thead><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>ON (event type)</b></p></td><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>DO (event routine)</b></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>CustomerArrival @ t</p></td><td><pre>INCREMENT queueLength

This results in a model with three classes, the object class <i>ServiceDesk</i> with an attribute <i>queueLength</i>, and the event classes <i>CustomerArrival</i> and <i>CustomerDeparture</i>, both with a reference property <i>serviceDesk</i> for referencing the service desk at which an event occurs. When we also want to compute the service utilization statistics, we need to add an attribute <i>serviceTime</i> to the <i>CustomerDeparture</i> class for being able to update the service utilization statistics when a customer departs.</p><p>Both event types, <i>CustomerArrival</i> and <i>CustomerDeparture</i>, now have a many-to-one association with the object type <i>ServiceDesk</i>. This expresses the fact that any such event occurs at a particular service desk, which participates in the event. This association is implemented in the form of a reference property <i>serviceDesk</i> in each of the two event types, as shown in <a class="role-figure-ref" href="#DesM__figServiceDesk1"><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-2</span>. </span>An information design model for ServiceDesk-1</a>.</p><figure id="DesM__figServiceDesk1"><figcaption><span class="role-label">Figure <span class="role-number">1-2</span>. </span>An information design model for ServiceDesk-1</figcaption><div><img alt="???" src="IntroTutorial_files/IDM1.svg" width="400" /></div></figure><p>In addition to an information model, we need to make a process model, which captures the dynamics of the service desk system consisting of arrival and departure events triggering state changes and follow-up events.</p><p>The following table shows the two event rules, which now account for the fact that both types of events occur at a particular service desk that is referenced by the event expression parameter <i>sd</i>.</p><table border="1" style="border-spacing:3px;width:100%;"><thead><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>ON (event type)</b></p></td><td style="text-align:center;"><p><b>DO (event routine)</b></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>CustomerArrival( sd) @ t</p><p>with sd : ServiceDesk</p></td><td><pre>INCREMENT sd.queueLength

It provides technologies, such as simulation libraries, frameworks, and simulators, as well as a collection of simulation examples. One important goal of Sim4edu is to facilitate building state-of-the-art user interfaces for simulations and simulation games without requiring simulation developers to learn all the recent web technologies involved (e.g., HTML5, CSS3, SVG and WebGL).</p><p>The JavaScript-based simulation framework <i>OESjs</i> implements the <i>Object Event Simulation (<a href="https://sim4edu.com/OES" target="_top">OES</a>)</i> paradigm, representing a general <i>Discrete Event Simulation</i> approach based on <i>object-oriented</i> modeling and <i>event scheduling</i>.

Choosing a continuous time model means that one has to define a <i>simulation time granularity</i>, as explained in the next sub-section.</p><p>In both cases, the underlying simulation <b><i>time unit</i></b> can be either left unspecified (e.g., in the case of an abstract time model), or it can be set to one of the time units &quot;ms&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;M&quot; or &quot;Y&quot;, as in</p><pre>sim.model.timeUnit = &quot;h&quot;;</pre><p>Typical examples of time models are:</p><ol><li><p>An abstract discrete model of time where time runs in steps without any concrete meaning: </p><pre>sim.model.time = &quot;discrete&quot;;</pre></li><li><p>A concrete discrete model of time in number of days: </p><pre>sim.model.time = &quot;discrete&quot;;
sim.model.timeUnit = &quot;D&quot;;</pre></li><li><p>A concrete continuous model of time in number of seconds: </p><pre>sim.model.time = &quot;continuous&quot;;
sim.model.timeUnit = &quot;s&quot;;</pre></li></ol><section><h4>2.1.1. Time Granularity</h4><p>When a simulation model is based on continuous time, it is possible to control the time granularity (the time delay until the next moment) in one of two ways:</p><ol><li>through simulation time rounding by setting the model parameter <i>timeRoundingDecimalPlaces</i> to a suitable value (e.g., to 2 for obtaining time values like 281.39), which implies a corresponding value of the model parameter <i>nextMomentDeltaT</i>;</li><li>by explicitly setting the model parameter <i>nextMomentDeltaT</i>.</li></ol><p>The model parameter <i>nextMomentDeltaT</i> is used by the simulator for scheduling next events with a minimal delay.</p></section><section><h4>2.1.2. Time Progression</h4><p>An important issue in simulation is the question how the simulation time is advanced by the simulator. The OES paradigm supports <strong>fixed-increment</strong> time progression and <strong>next-event</strong> time progression, and their combination.</p><p>An OESjs model with pure fixed-increment time progression defines an <code>OnEachTimeStep</code> procedure and a <code>timeIncrement</code> parameter, but no event types. Such a model can be used</p><ol><li>for modeling continuous state changes (e.g., objects moving in a continuous space), or</li><li>as a discrete model that abstracts away from explicit events and uses only implicit periodic time events (&quot;ticks&quot;), which is a popular approach in social science simulation.</li></ol><p>A simulation model with pure next-event time progression, representing a classical DES model, defines event types and event rules, but no <code>timeIncrement</code> parameter.</p><p>It is also possible to combine both time progression mechanisms, e.g., in a &quot;hybrid&quot; model that supports both discrete and continuous state changes, or in a social science model based on &quot;ticks&quot; and explicit events.</p></section><section><h4>2.1.3. Real-Time Simulation</h4><p>Real-time simulation means to run an observable simulation model in such a way that the speed of its state changes is close to the speed of the state changes in the simulated real-world system. This is only possible if the simulator is able to run the simulation at least as fast as the real-world system is running. If this is the case, the running simulator can be slowed down to real-time speed. </p><p>Real-time simulation requires fixed-increment time progression by setting the model parameter <i>timeIncrement</i>. In the case of a model with a <i>timeUnit</i> and real-time simulation turned on (by setting the scenario parameter <i>realtimeFactor</i> to 1), the simulator delays each simulation step such that its real duration is equal to its simulation time, which is <i>timeIncrement</i> [timeUnit].</p><p>In the case of a model without a <i>timeUnit</i> (that is, with abstract time), the simulator cannot automatically run in real-time, but the scenario parameter <i>stepDuration</i> (for specifying the real duration of a simulation step) can be set to a suitable value for making the simulation observable in real-time.</p></section></section><section class="role-section1" id="SimModels"><h2 class="role-section1-title"><span class="role-label"><span class="role-number">2.2</span>. </span>Simulation Models</h2><section><h4>2.2.1. Model Variables and Functions</h4><p>In the simple model of a service desk discussed in the previous section, we define one (global) model variable, <i>queueLength</i>, one model function, <i>serviceDuration</i>(), and two event types, as shown in the following class diagram: </p><figure><img alt="???" src="IntroTutorial_files/IDM0.svg" width="360" /></figure><p>Notice that this model does not define any object type, which implies that the system state does not consist of any object, but only of one model variable, <span class="italic"><i>queueLength</i></span>. The discrete random variable for modeling random service durations is implemented as a model function <code>serviceDuration</code> shown in the <i>Model Variables and Functions</i> class. It samples integers between 2 and 4 from the empirical probability distribution <i>Emp{2:0.3, 3:0.5, 4:0.2}</i>. The model can be coded with OESjs in the following way:</p><table class="role-listing" style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;"><colgroup class="listing-numbers-column" style="width: 2.25em;"></colgroup><tbody style="vertical-align: baseline;"><tr><td class="listing-numbers"><pre style="text-align: right; background-color: transparent; border-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">1

Event rules are discussed below. Exogenous events occur periodically. They are therefore defined with a <em>recurrence</em> function,<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__7"></a> which provides the time in-between two events (often in the form of a random variable).

The OESjs simulator automatically creates the next <i>CustomerArrival</i> event by invoking the <i>recurrence</i> function for setting its <i>ocurrenceTime</i> and by copying all participant references (such as the <i>serviceDesk</i> reference). Only if an exogenous event<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__8"></a> type has additional properties, a <i>createNextEvent</i> method has to be defined for assigning all properties and returning the next event of that type.

Consequently, a simulator (like OESjs) must be able to process simultaneous events.<a class="role-index-anchor" id="SimModels__I__b"></a> In particular, simulation models based on discrete time may create simulation states where two or more events occur at the same time, but the model's logic requires them to be processed in a certain order. Defining priorities for events of a certain type helps to control the processing order of simultaneous events.</p><p>Consider an example model based on discrete time with three exogenous event types <i>StartOfMonth</i>, <i>EachDay</i> and <i>EndOfMonth</i>, where the recurrence of StartOfMonth and EndOfMonth is 21, and the recurrence of EachDay is 1. In this example we want to control that on simulation time 1 + <i>i</i> * 21 both a StartOfMonth and an EachDay event occur simultaneously, but StartOfMonth should be processed before EachDay, and on simulation time 21 + <i>i</i> * 21 both an EndOfMonth and an EachDay event occur simultaneously, but EndOfMonth should be processed after EachDay. This can be achieved by defining a high priority, say 2, to StartOfMonth, a middle priority, say 1, to StartOfMonth, and a low priority, say 0, to EndOfMonth. </p><p>Event priorities are defined as class-level properties of event classes in the event type definition file. Thus, we would define in <kbd>StartOfMonth.js</kbd>:</p><pre>StartOfMonth.priority = 2;</pre><p>and in <kbd>EachDay.js</kbd>:</p><pre>EachDay.priority = 1;</pre><p>and finally in <kbd>EndOfMonth.js</kbd>:</p><pre>EndOfMonth.priority = 0;</pre></section><section><h4>2.2.6.

OESjs allows adding the following user interfaces (UI) to a simulation model:</p><ol><li>An <strong>observation UI</strong> defines various kinds of visualizations (including 3D) for allowing the user to observe what is going on during a simulation run. Space models, objects and events can be visualized by defining a <em>view</em> for them. An <em>object view</em> is defined by a 2D shape (like a <em>rectangle</em> or a <em>polygon</em>) or a 3D shape (like a <em>cuboid</em> or a <em>mesh</em>). An <em>event view</em> consists of an animation defined in the form of a <em>Web Animation</em> (of one or more DOM elements using key frames). Events can also be <em>sonified</em> by attaching specific sounds to event occurrences in an event appearance definition.</li><li>A <strong>user interaction UI</strong> allows human users to interact with a running simulation by taking decisions on the values of decision variables or by taking actions that change the value of certain simulation variables.</li><li>A <strong>participation UI</strong> allows human users to participate in a multi-agent simulation scenario by receiving situational information and by performing in-world actions via the user interface. Any multi-agent simulation model can be turned into a user-interactive <em>participatory simulation</em> by adding a <em>participation model</em> and a corresponding UI.</li></ol><section><h4>2.7.1. Adding an Observation User Interface</h4><p>For being able to observe a simulation run, some form of visualization has to be defined. OESjs supports both the visualization of <em>spatial models</em> and of non-spatial models. In a visualization of a non-spatial model, such as the ServiceDesk-1 model, all object views have to be explicitly positioned in an observation canvas. Rich two-dimensional visualizations can be obtained by using the web technology of <em>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</em> in the definition of the observation UI.</p><p>In the case of our <em>ServiceDesk-1</em> model, we may, for instance, visualize the service desk using either an image or simply a fixed-size rectangle, and its queue in the form of a growing and shrinking bar.</p><p>For defining an observation UI with SVG-based visualization, the following settings have to be made:</p><table class="role-listing" style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;"><colgroup class="listing-numbers-column" style="width: 2.0em;"></colgroup><tbody style="vertical-align: baseline;"><tr><td class="listing-numbers"><pre style="text-align: right; background-color: transparent; border-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">1
