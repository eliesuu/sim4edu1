    <h2 id="Q0">1 Are JavaScript simulations only good for educational purposes?</h2>

    <p>No, you can use JavaScript-based simulation technologies for all kinds of simulations that you want to share or publish easily and where you do not need top-notch high-performance computing (typically achieved with C and C++).</p>

    <p>Our platform name "Simulation for Education" is to deliver the message that JavaScript-based simulation technologies have a great potential for educational simulation, which includes both learning how to develop simulations and using simulation for learning statistics, management, biology, sociology, economics, etc.</p>

    <h2 id="Q1">2 Why should I learn JavaScript?</h2>

    <p>JavaScript is the world's <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2016/07/20/language-rankings-6-16/">most widely used</a> programming language, and it's growing faster than any other popular language. As a high-level scripting language, it's relatively easy to learn, compared to C++/Java/C#. You can basically build anything with JavaScript, and easily share it with anyone.</p>

    <h3>Why should, for instance, a Java expert want to learn JavaScript?</h3>
	
	<p>Learning JavaScript, and the Node.js platform, can be a breath of fresh air for a long-time Java expert. Read why</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>Java is full of boilerplate code which obscures the programmer's intention;</li>
	 <li>The experience of using the Spring framework is great until it isn’t (until that day an obscure impossible-to-understand Exception appears out of the depths of a subsystem you’ve never heard of requiring 3+ days just to figure out what's the problem).</li>
	</ul>

    <h2 id="Q2">3 How can I learn JavaScript?</h2>

    <p>There are tons of JS learning materials available on the web (we recommend to check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">MDN resources</a>), and there are JS coding schools (such as <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a>) where you can take courses for free.</p>

    <p>If you are already experienced in object-oriented programming (OOP), e.g., with Java, C#, PHP or Python, then you may just read a <a href="http://web-engineering.info/tech/JavaScript/Summary.html">JS summary article</a> (also available as <a href="http://web-engineering.info/tech/JavaScript/Summary.pdf">PDF</a>) to get into it and understand how it differs from classical OOP languages.</p>

    <h2 id="Q3">4 Isn’t JavaScript a toy language that can't be used for serious projects?</h2>

    <p>With version ES5 (defined in 2011), JavaScript mutated into a full-fledged programming language that can be used for programming all kinds of software applications and tools. It combines object-oriented&nbsp;programming with functional programming.</p>

    <h2 id="Q4">5 Isn’t JavaScript too slow for simulation?</h2>

    <p>JavaScript is — for most practical purposes — as fast as high-performance languages. Back-end JavaScript (with Node.js) is orders of magnitude faster than Python, Ruby, and PHP. It is also nearly as fast as high-performance languages like C++, Java, and C#.</p>

    <p>Sim4edu simulations can be run both in a browser on a front-end device, or they can be run with NodeJS on a back-end machine for speeding up simulation experiments.</p>

    <h2 id="Q5">6 Isn't JavaScript unsafe because it's not statically typed?</h2>

    <p>Like Python and Ruby, JavaScript is dynamically typed, which is convenient. But you can get into trouble. Putting checks in place and writing tests helps to prevent typing errors.</p>
